The Dynatrace FastPack for Demandware provides a preconfigured Dynatrace profile custom tailored to Demandware environments. This FastPack contains sensors, a template system profile with measures and business transactions, and dashboards for the Demandware platform. Because the Demandware integration with UEM leverages CORS, there are a few measures that will likely have to be customized to your environment.
