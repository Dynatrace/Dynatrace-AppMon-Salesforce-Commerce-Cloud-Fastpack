The Dynatrace FastPack for Demandware provides a preconfigured Dynatrace profile custom tailored to Demandware environments. This FastPack contains sensors, a template system profile with measures and business transactions, and dashboards for the Demandware platform. Because the Demandware integration with UEM leverages CORS, there are a few measures that will likely have to be customized to your environment. 

Customizations:
Dynatrace for Demandware is only for UEM via [CORS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) as java agents are not allowed on the Demandware JVMS
